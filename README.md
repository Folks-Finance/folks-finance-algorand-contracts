# folks-finance-contracts
In this repository you can find the TEAL implementation for the Folks Finance smart contracts. The code was originally developed in PyTeal which we plan to release at a later date.

If no clear program is explicitly listed then the application uses the `contracts/v1/clear_program.teal`.

## Audit
An audit of these contracts has been completed by [Runtime Verification](https://github.com/runtimeverification/publications/blob/296a04aabf9006450306cb5da9ce223a0768a68e/reports/smart-contracts/Folks-Finance-Design-Review.pdf) and [Vantage Point](https://github.com/vantagepointreports/releases/blob/9c2a6e0d157b674a89dae18eefeac4bc921cce40/VPQ-20210652%20-%20Folks.Finance%20-%20Smart%20Contract%20Audit%20-%20Phase%201_Public_V1.0.pdf).
